MSM SoC HSUSB controllers

EHCI

Required properties:
- compatible:	Should contain "qcom,ehci-host"
- regs:			offset and length of the register set in the memory map
- usb-phy:		phandle for the PHY device

Example EHCI controller device node:

	ehci: ehci@f9a55000 {
		compatible = "qcom,ehci-host";
		reg = <0xf9a55000 0x400>;
		usb-phy = <&usb_otg>;
	};


ANDROID USB:

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "qcom,android-usb"

Optional properties :
- reg  : offset and length of memory region that is used by device to
  update USB PID and serial numbers used by bootloader in DLOAD mode.
- qcom,android-usb-swfi-latency : value to be used by device to vote
  for DMA latency in microsecs.
- qcom,streaming-func : add list of usb function name. If mention usb function
  is being enable as part of USB composition, streaming mode is enable with
  usb device controller to get better throughput. NOTE: Inverted CRC and
  turnaround timeout is observed on enabling streaming. Hence it is required
  to see these errors and number of erros on enabling this at USB level to make
  final decision to enable this feature or not.
Example Android USB device node :
	android_usb@fc42b0c8 {
		compatible = "qcom,android-usb";
		reg = <0xfc42b0c8 0xc8>;
		qcom,android-usb-swfi-latency = <1>;
		qcom,streaming-func = "rndis","mtp";
	};
