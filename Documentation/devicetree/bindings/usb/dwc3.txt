synopsys DWC3 CORE

DWC3- USB3 CONTROLLER

Required properties:
 - compatible: must be "snps,dwc3"
 - reg : Address and length of the register set for the device
 - interrupts: Interrupts used by the dwc3 controller.
 - interrupt-names : Required interrupt resource entries are:
	"irq" : Interrupt for DWC3 core
	"otg_irq" : Interrupt for DWC3 core's OTG Events
 - usb-phy : array of phandle for the PHY device.  The first element
   in the array is expected to be a handle to the USB2/HS PHY and
   the second element is expected to be a handle to the USB3/SS PHY

Optional properties:
 - tx-fifo-resize: determines if the FIFO *has* to be reallocated.

This is usually a subnode to DWC3 glue to which it is connected.
