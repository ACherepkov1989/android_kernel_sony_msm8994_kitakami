SMB135x battery charger

SMB135x is a single-cell switching mode battery charger. It can charge
the battery and power the system via the USB and AC adapter input.

The smb135x interface is via I2C bus.

Required Properties:
- compatible:			Must be "qcom,smb1357-charger" or  "qcom,smb1359-charger".
- reg:				The device 7-bit I2C address.

Optional Properties:

- interrupts			This indicates the IRQ number of the GPIO
				connected to the STAT pin.
- qcom,bms-psy-name	 	the psy name to use for reporting battery capacity. If left
				unspecified it uses a preprogrammed default value.
- qcom,float-voltage-mv	 	Float Voltage in mV - the maximum voltage up to which
				the battery is charged. Supported range 3600mV to 4500mV
- qcom,charging-timeout		Maximum duration in minutes that a single charge
				cycle may last.  Supported values are: 0, 192, 384,
				768, and 1536.  A value of 0 means that no
				charge cycle timeout is used and charging can
				continue indefinitely.
- qcom,dc-psy-type		The type of charger connected to the DC path.
				Can be "Mains" or "Wireless"
- qcom,dc-psy-ma		The current in mA dc path can support. Must be specified if
				dc-psy-type is specified. Valid range 300mA to 2000mA.
- qcom,charging-disabled	Set this if charging should be disabled in the build
				by default. Useful in usecases where battery current
				needs to be profiled even when USB is present.
- qcom,recharge-thresh-mv	Specifies the minimum voltage drop in millivolts
				below the float voltage that is required in
				order to initiate a new charging cycle.
				Supported values are: 50, 100, 200 and 300mV.
- qcom,bmd-algo-disabled	Indicates if the battery missing detection algorithm
				is disabled. If this node is present SMB uses
				the THERM pin for battery missing detection.
- qcom,iterm-ma			Specifies the termination current to indicate end-of-charge.
				Possible values in mA - 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 500, 600.
- qcom,iterm-disabled		Disables the termination current feature. This is a bool
				property.
- qcom,soft-vfloat-comp-disabled	Set this property when the battery is powered via external
					source and could go above the float voltage.  smb135x chips
					go in to unintentional reverse boost in such a situation and
					the float voltage compensation needs to be disabled to avoid
					that reverse boost.
- qcom,thermal-mitigation:		Array of input current limit values for different
					system thermal mitigation level.
- regulator-name			A string used as a descriptive name for OTG regulator.
- therm-bias-supply			The supply that provides bias voltage to the battery
					thermistor. This is useful in designs that do not use the SYSON
					pin to bias the thermistor.
- qcom,parallel-charger:		A flag to indicate if the charger merely assists for USB
					charging. In this case the input current from USB is split
					between a main charger and smb135x for reducing thermal impact
					of high current charging from USB path.
- qcom,inhibit-disabled:	Disables the charger-inhibit function.

			compatible = "qcom,smb1357-charger";
			reg = <0x1b>;
			interrupt-parent = <&spmi_bus>;
			interrupts = <0x00 0xCD 0>;
			qcom,float-voltage-mv = <4200>;
			qcom,iterm-ma = <100>;
			qcom,dc-psy-type = <8>;
			qcom,dc-psy-ma = <800>;
			qcom,charging-disabled;
			qcom,recharge-thresh-mv = <100>;
			regulator-name = "smb1357-otg";
			qcom,thermal-mitigation = <1500 700 600 325>;
		};
