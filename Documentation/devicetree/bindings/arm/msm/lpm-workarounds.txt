* LPM Workarounds

The required properties are:

- compatible: "qcom,lpm-workarounds"

The optional properties are:

- qcom,lpm-wa-cx-turbo-unvote: Indicates the workaround to unvote CX turbo
	vote when system is coming out of rpm assisted power collaspe.
	lpm-cx-supply is required if this is present.

- lpm-cx-supply:  will hold handle for CX regulator supply which is used
	to unvote.

- qcom,lpm-wa-skip-l2-spm: Due to a hardware bug on 8939 and 8909, secure
	world needs to disable and enable L2 SPM to get the proper context
	in secure watchdog bite cases. With this workaround there is a race
	in programming L2 SPM between HLOS and secure world. This leads to
	stability issues. To avoid this program L2 SPM only in secure world
	based on the L2 mode flag passed. Set lpm-wa-skip-l2-spm node if this
	is required.

Example:

qcom,lpm-workarounds {
	compatible = "qcom,lpm-workarounds";

	lpm-cx-supply = <&pm8916_s2_corner>;
	qcom,lpm-wa-cx-turbo-unvote;
	qcom,lpm-wa-skip-l2-spm;
}
