L2 Cache Clock Controller

The L2 Cache Clock Controller provides clock, power domain, and
reset control to a L2-cache for a cluster. There is L2CCC register
region per CPU Cluster.

Required properties:
- compatible:	Can be one of:
		"qcom,8994-l2ccc"
		"qcom,8916-l2ccc"
		"qcom,msmthulium-l2ccc"
- reg:		This specifies the base address and size of
		the register region.

Optional properties:
- reg:		For "qcom,8994-l2ccc only", an optional second tuple specifies
		the shared common base address required to trigger the L2 SPM
		out of power collapse.
		For "qcom,msmthulium-l2ccc" only, an optional second tuple
		specifies the address of the CLKSEL register for the cluster.
- qcom,cbf-clock-seq: For "qcom,msmthulium-l2ccc" only, specify this to
		temporarily select the CBF clock source while powering up the
		L2. If present, the CLKSEL "reg" tuple must also be specified
		as described above.
- qcom,vctl-node: Reference to a node that controls the power rails for the
 cluster.
- qcom,vctl-val: The voltage control register value that must be set before
		the caches can be turned on. This would be a required property
		if the target necessitates a voltage rail be turned on before
		turning on the cache.
Example:

	clock-controller@f900f000 {
		compatible = "qcom,8994-l2ccc"";
		reg = <0xf900f000 0x1000>,
			<0xf911210c 0x4>;
		qcom,vctl-node = <&cluster_node>;
		qcom,vctl-val = <0xb8>;
	}
