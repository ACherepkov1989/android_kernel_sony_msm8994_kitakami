* ARM Performance Monitor Units

ARM cores often have a PMU for counting cpu and cache events like cache misses
and hits. The interface to the PMU is part of the ARM ARM. The ARM PMU
representation in the device tree should be done as under:-

Required properties:

- compatible : should be one of
	"arm,armv8-pmuv3"
	"arm,cortex-a15-pmu"
	"arm,cortex-a9-pmu"
	"arm,cortex-a8-pmu"
	"arm,cortex-a7-pmu"
	"arm,cortex-a5-pmu"
	"arm,arm11mpcore-pmu"
	"arm,arm1176-pmu"
	"arm,arm1136-pmu"
	"qcom,krait-pmu"
- interrupts : 1 combined interrupt or 1 per core.
- cluster : a phandle to the cluster to which it belongs
	If there are more than one cluster with same CPU type
	then there should be separate PMU nodes per cluster.

Optional:
- qcom,irq-is-percpu:   Define this if the IRQ of the PMU is a PPI. This will tell perf to use
			the per_cpu IRQ API for request and free.

Example:

pmu {
        compatible = "arm,cortex-a9-pmu";
        interrupts = <100 101>;
};

For the L2CC PMU:
If the L2 cache controller PMU is available, its DT bindings should be defined as
follows.

Required Properties:

- compatible: Should be "qcom,l2-pmu"
- interrupts : 1 combined interrupt.

Example:

  l2-pmu {
                compatible = "qcom,l2-pmu";
                interrupts = <0 1 0>;
        };
