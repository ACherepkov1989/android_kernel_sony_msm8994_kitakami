InvenSense MPU6050 6 Axis gyroscope+accelerometer combo driver

Required properties:

 - compatible		: Should be "invn,mpu6050".
 - reg				: i2c slave address of the device.
 - interrupt-parent	: Parent of interrupt.
 - interrupts		: Gyrometer sample interrupt to indicate new data ready.
 - vdd-supply		: Analog power supply needed to power device.
 - vlogic-supply	: Digital IO power supply needed for IO and I2C.
 - vi2c-supply		: Digital IO Power supply needed for I2C.
 - invn,place		: The placing of the accelerometer on board. There are 8
				patterns of placing described as below:
				"Portrait Up": Portrait Up
				"Landscape Right": Landscape Right
				"Portrait Down": Portrait Down
				"Landscape Left": Landscape Left
				"Portrait Up Back Side": Portrait Up (back side view)
				"Landscape Right Back Side": Landscape Right (back side view)
				"Portrait Down Back Side": Portrait Down (back side view)
				"Landscape Left Back Side": Landscape Left (back side view)

Optional properties:

 - invn,use-interrupt	: use device interrupt to trigger data acquisition
			instead of polling data.
 - invn,gpio-int	: GPIO used for interrupt.
 - invn,gpio-en		: GPIO used for power enabling.

Example:
	i2c@f9925000 {
		mpu6050@68 {
			reg = <0x68>;
			compatible = "invn,mpu6050";
			interrupt-parent = <&msm_gpio>;
			interrupts = <84 0x2>;
			vlogic-supply = <&pm8916_l17>;
			vdd-supply = <&pm8916_l6>;
			vi2c-supply = <&pm8916_l16>;
			invn,place = "Portrait Up";
		};
	};
