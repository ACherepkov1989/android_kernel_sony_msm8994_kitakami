* ARM PrimeCell MultiMedia Card Interface (MMCI) PL180/1

The ARM PrimeCell MMCI PL180 and PL181 provides an interface for
reading and writing to MultiMedia and SD cards alike.

This file documents differences between the core properties described
by mmc.txt and the properties used by the mmci driver.

Required properties:
- compatible             : contains "arm,pl18x", "arm,primecell".
- vmmc-supply            : phandle to the regulator device tree node, mentioned
                           as the VCC/VDD supply in the eMMC/SD specs.

Optional properties:
- arm,primecell-periphid : contains the PrimeCell Peripheral ID, it overrides
                           the ID provided by the HW
- mmc-cap-mmc-highspeed  : indicates whether MMC is high speed capable.
- mmc-cap-sd-highspeed   : indicates whether SD is high speed capable.
- vqmmc-supply           : phandle to the regulator device tree node, mentioned
                           as the VCCQ/VDD_IO supply in the eMMC/SD specs.

Example:

sdi0_per1@80126000 {
	compatible = "arm,pl18x", "arm,primecell";
	reg = <0x80126000 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <0 60 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;

	dmas = <&dma 29 0 0x2>, /* Logical - DevToMem */
	       <&dma 29 0 0x0>; /* Logical - MemToDev */
	dma-names = "rx", "tx";

	clocks = <&prcc_kclk 1 5>, <&prcc_pclk 1 5>;
	clock-names = "sdi", "apb_pclk";

	max-frequency = <100000000>;
	bus-width = <4>;
	mmc-cap-sd-highspeed;
	mmc-cap-mmc-highspeed;
	cd-gpios  = <&gpio2 31 0x4>; // 95

	vmmc-supply = <&ab8500_ldo_aux3_reg>;
	vqmmc-supply = <&vmmci>;

	pinctrl-names = "default", "sleep";
	pinctrl-0 = <&sdi0_default_mode>;
	pinctrl-1 = <&sdi0_sleep_mode>;
};
