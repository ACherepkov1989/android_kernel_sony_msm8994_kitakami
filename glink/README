Subsystem: kernel-tests/glink

Test: run.sh [-n | --nominal] [-a | --adversarial] [-r | --repeatability] [-s| stress ] [--custom_flag X]
Parameters:
  -v: Verbosity (Set to 0 for minimal verbosity, 1 to include details)
  -n: Nominal test case (runs all level 0 unit tests)
  -a: Adversarial test case (runs all unit tests)
  -r: Repeatability test case (Run -n and -a 10 times each)
  -s: Stress test case (runs all unit tests)
  --custom_flag: Not used

Description:
  G-Link, short for Generic Link, is a generic link-layer transport that
  supports a plug-in framework for physical transports. This allows it to adapt
  to different physical transports such as shared memory, UARTs, buses, and DMA.

  See the <kernel>/Documentation/arm/msm/glink.txt file for more details.

  This test suite contains a mock transport, loopback transport, loopback
  client, and unit tests. The unit tests validate behavior against mock objects,
  local loopback system, and remote loopback with different subsystems.
  Verified behavior includes:
       * channel state behavior and callbacks
       * basic data transfer
       * performance including throughput and latency

Target support: Future
Notes: A subset of the tests are run for automation.
