SWP Kernel Test

usage: ./swp_test

Description:
The use of SWP is deprecated in ARMv6 and above. Since there are a number of existing Android
apps that use this instruction, we need to make sure that the SWP emulation feature is present
and enabled in our kernels. This kernel test is to emulate the deprecated ‘swp’ instruction


SWP Rt, Rt2, [Rn]

Rt : is the destination register.
Rt2 : is the source register. Rt2 can be the same register as Rt.
Rn : contains the address in memory. Rn must be a different register from both Rt and Rt2.
