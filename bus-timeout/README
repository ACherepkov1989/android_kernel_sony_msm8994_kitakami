	Bus Timeout Documentation

Usage: insert module

OPTIONS: (none)

TEST BEHAVIOR: Force a bus hang. If successful, the target will be reset by
the watchdog. The kernel will panic on a failure. Returning back to the command
prompt is also considered a failure.

LIMITATIONS: In order for the test to run correctly, clocks must be off.
Unfortunately, there is no guarantee with the public clock APIs that the
clock will actually be off after one clk_disable call. The easiest way
to guarantee that the disable will actually work is to make sure the
system is not using the required clocks.

For this module, the camera must not be on while attempting to do the
test since the camera registers are used for testing.

TARGETS: 8974
