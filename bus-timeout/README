Test:Bus Timeout Documentation

Usage: bus_timeout_test.sh [-c | --camera-timeout] [ -u | --usb-timeout]
                           [-p | --pc-save] [-h | --help]

OPTIONS:
The following options can be used:
-c | --camera-timeout         trigger a camera bus timeout
-u | --usb-timeout            trigger a usb bus timeout
-p | --pc-save                trigger a sec wdog bite which will save the last
                                  executing instruction.

TEST BEHAVIOR: Force a bus hang. If successful, the target will be reset by
the watchdog. The kernel will panic on a failure. Returning back to the command
prompt is also considered a failure.

LIMITATIONS: In order for the test to run correctly, clocks must be off.
Unfortunately, there is no guarantee with the public clock APIs that the
clock will actually be off after one clk_disable call. The easiest way
to guarantee that the disable will actually work is to make sure the
system is not using the required clocks.

For this module, the camera must not be on while attempting to do the
test since the camera registers are used for testing. The usb cable
must not be plugged in while attempting to do the usb timeout test.
