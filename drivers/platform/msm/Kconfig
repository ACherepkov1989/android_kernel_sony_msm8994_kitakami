config MSM_BUS_SCALING
	bool "Bus scaling driver"
	default n
	help
		This option enables bus scaling on MSM devices.  Bus scaling
		allows devices to request the clocks be set to rates sufficient
		for the active devices needs without keeping the clocks at max
		frequency when a slower speed is sufficient.

config BUS_TOPOLOGY_ADHOC
	bool "ad-hoc bus scaling topology"
	default n
	help
		This option enables a driver that can handle adhoc bus topologies.
		Adhoc bus topology driver allows one to many connections and maintains
		directionality of connections by explicitly listing device connections
		thus avoiding illegal routes.

config SPS
	bool "SPS support"
	select GENERIC_ALLOCATOR
	help
	  The SPS (Smart Peripheral Switch) is a DMA engine.
	  It can move data in the following modes:
		1. Peripheral-to-Peripheral.
		2. Peripheral-to-Memory.
		3. Memory-to-Memory.

config USB_BAM
	boolean "USB BAM Driver"
	depends on SPS && USB_GADGET
	help
	  Enabling this option adds USB BAM Driver.
	  USB BAM driver was added to supports SPS Peripheral-to-Peripheral
	  transfers between the USB and other peripheral.

config SPS_SUPPORT_BAMDMA
	bool "SPS support BAM DMA"
	depends on SPS
	default n
	help
	  The BAM-DMA is used for Memory-to-Memory transfers.
	  The main use cases is RPC between processors.
	  The BAM-DMA hardware has 2 registers sets:
		1. A BAM HW like all the peripherals.
		2. A DMA channel configuration (i.e. channel priority).

config SPS_SUPPORT_NDP_BAM
	bool "SPS support NDP BAM"
	depends on SPS
	default n
	help
	  No-Data-Path BAM is used to improve BAM performance.
