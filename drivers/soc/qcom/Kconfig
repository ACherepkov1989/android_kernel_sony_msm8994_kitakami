	depends on MSM_SMD
	bool "MSM SMD debug support"
	help
	  Support for debugging SMD and SMSM communication between apps and
	  other processors in the SoC. Debug support primarily consists of
	  logs consisting of information such as what interrupts were processed,
	  what channels caused interrupt activity, and when internal state
	  change events occur.

config MSM_RPM_SMD
	bool "RPM driver using SMD protocol"
	help
	  RPM is the dedicated hardware engine for managing shared SoC
	  resources. This config adds driver support for using SMD as a
	  transport layer communication with RPM hardware. It also selects
	  the MSM_MPM config that programs the MPM module to monitor interrupts
	  during sleep modes.

	bool "SMSM Point-to-Point (SMP2P)"
	depends on MSM_SMEM
	help
	  Provide point-to-point remote signaling support.
	  SMP2P enables transferring 32-bit values between
	  the local and a remote system using shared
	  memory and interrupts. A client can open multiple
	  32-bit values by specifying a unique string and
	  remote processor ID.

config MSM_SMP2P_TEST
	bool "SMSM Point-to-Point Test"
	depends on MSM_SMP2P
	help
	  Enables loopback and unit testing support for
	  SMP2P. Loopback support is used by other
	  processors to do unit testing. Unit tests

        depends on MSM_OCMEM
        help
          Enable direct power management of the OCMEM core by the
          OCMEM driver. By default power management is delegated to

          directly handle the various macro power transitions.

config MSM_OCMEM_DEBUG
        bool "OCMEM Debug Support"
        depends on MSM_OCMEM
        help
          Enable debug options for On-chip Memory (OCMEM) driver.

        bool "OCMEM Non Secure Mode"
        depends on MSM_OCMEM_DEBUG
        help
          Disable OCMEM interaction with secure processor.
          By default OCMEM is secured and accesses for each master
          is requested by the OCMEM driver. Selecting this option
          causes the OCMEM memory to be in non-secure state unless
          its locked down by the secure processor.

config MSM_OCMEM_POWER_DEBUG
        bool "OCMEM Power Debug Support"
        depends on MSM_OCMEM_DEBUG

          Disable all OCMEM power management.
          Skip all OCMEM power operations that turn ON or
          turn OFF the macros. Both local power management and
          RPM assisted power management operations are skipped.
          Enable this configuration if OCMEM is being exclusively
          used as GMEM or OCIMEM.

config MSM_SUBSYSTEM_RESTART
	bool "MSM Subsystem Restart"
	help
	  This option enables the MSM subsystem restart framework.

	help
	  This enables the watchdog module. It causes kernel panic if the
	  watchdog times out. It allows for detection of cpu hangs and
	  deadlocks. It does not run during the bootup process, so it will
	  not catch any early lockups.
