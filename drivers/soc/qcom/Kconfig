          Say y here to enable GSBI support.  The GSBI provides control
          functions for connecting the underlying serial UART, SPI, and I2C
          devices to the output pins.

	help
	  Support for the shared memory interprocessor communication protocol
	  which provides virual point to point serial channels between processes
	  on the apps processor and processes on other processors in the SoC.
	  Also includes support for the Shared Memory State Machine (SMSM)
	  protocol which provides a mechanism to publish single bit state
	  information to one or more processors in the SoC.

config MSM_SMD_DEBUG
	depends on MSM_SMD
	bool "MSM SMD debug support"
	help
	  Support for debugging SMD and SMSM communication between apps and
	  other processors in the SoC. Debug support primarily consists of
	  logs consisting of information such as what interrupts were processed,
	  what channels caused interrupt activity, and when internal state
	  change events occur.

config MSM_SMEM
	depends on REMOTE_SPINLOCK_MSM
	bool "MSM Shared Memory (SMEM)"
	help
	  Support for the shared memory interface between the various
	  processors in the System on a Chip (SoC) which allows basic
	  inter-processor communication.
