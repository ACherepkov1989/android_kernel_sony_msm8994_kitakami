Subsystem: kernel-tests/bam_dmux_loopback

Test: bam_dmux_loopback_ktest.sh
Parameters:
  -n: Nominal test case (Basic data connectivity test)
  -a: Adversarial test case (Currently holds no tests)
  -r: Repeatability test case (Multiple iterations of the nominal test)
  -s: Stress test case (Performs a basic throughput test)
  -h: Help text.

Description:
This test isolates the bam_dmux driver from the hardware and establishes a
loopback path by simulating the hardware for the purposes of unit testing and
validation of the driver in isolation.

Target support:
This test is applicable to any target which has a bam_dmux based data path,
including but not limited to 8960, 8974, and 8916.

Notes:
Unloading the kernel module to return the bam_dmux driver to normal mode is
disabled due to design limitations.  The current workaround to restore the data
path is to restart the device.
